## ðŸš€ ROUND 1 DISCUSSION: CORE VISION ALIGNMENT

### **Maya Rodriguez (Creative Director):**
*"Let's start with the user's emotional journey. When someone says 'I'm sad' or 'I'm stressed,' we're not just generating a game - we're creating a personalized therapeutic experience. The ASCII aesthetic isn't just retro cool, it's intentionally calming, nostalgic, safe. Like a digital comfort blanket."*

### **Dr. Priya Patel (Behavioral Psychology):**
*"Maya's absolutely right. The ASCII choice is psychologically brilliant. It removes visual overwhelm, creates focus, and triggers positive nostalgia. But we need to be careful - different emotional states need different interaction patterns. Depression needs gentle progression, anxiety needs control, anger needs release mechanisms."*

### **Alex Chen (CTO):**
*"From a technical standpoint, ASCII gives us massive performance advantages. Low bandwidth, fast rendering, works on any device. But the real innovation is the agent swarm architecture. Instead of if-then logic, we have AI agents that actually understand context and create appropriate responses. Cerebras speed makes this possible."*

### **Sam Taylor (AI Pipeline Architect):**
*"The agent swarm is where we differentiate. I envision 7-9 core agent types, each with specialized personalities and expertise. They don't just execute pre-written functions - they think, debate, create. User sees this happening in real-time. It's like watching AI consciousness emerge to solve their specific emotional need."*

### **Jordan Kim (Product Strategy):**
*"This positioning is perfect for the hackathon narrative: 'First AI system that creates games through emergent agent collaboration.' We're not just showing fast inference - we're showing AI creativity, empathy, and teamwork. That's next-level impressive."*

### **Riley Martinez (Full-Stack Engineer):**
*"Implementation-wise, we need WebSocket streams for real-time agent communication display. Users watch agents spawn, discuss, build. The game materializes before their eyes. Technically challenging but achievable with proper event architecture."*

### **Marcus Thompson (DevOps):**
*"Deployment considerations: This needs to be dead simple to demo. Single URL, no installation, works on mobile. We're talking static hosting with serverless functions for Cerebras API calls. Fast, reliable, scalable."*

### **Elena Volkov (Business Development):**
*"The Cerebras partnership angle is golden. We're showcasing their inference speed through something emotionally meaningful. This isn't just a tech demo - it's a glimpse of AI-powered mental health tools, educational gaming, personalized entertainment. Multiple market applications."*
