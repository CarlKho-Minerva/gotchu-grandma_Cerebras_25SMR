# Round 8: Resource Planning & Risk Management

**Date:** August 16, 2025 - 9:00 AM
**Duration:** 4 hours
**Participants:** Full Team - Operations & Risk Assessment

---

## ‚ö° OPERATIONS & RISK ROUNDTABLE

*After 2 days of operational planning, the team has developed comprehensive resource allocation and risk mitigation strategies.*

---

## üéØ RESOURCE ALLOCATION STRATEGY

### **Alex Chen (CTO):**
*"Technical resource allocation is clear. 60% of development time on core game generation engine, 25% on user interface, 15% on agent visualization. We can MVP this with current team size."*

### **Marcus Thompson (DevOps):**
*"Infrastructure costs are surprisingly low. Static hosting plus Cerebras API calls puts us under $500/month for first 1000 users. Scaling economics are excellent - mostly variable costs that grow with revenue."*

### **Jordan Kim (Product Strategy):**
*"Team scaling plan: Start with current 8-person team for hackathon, add 2 developers and 1 designer for post-hackathon growth phase. Total budget needed: $150K for first 6 months."*

Probability: Medium (20%)
Mitigation:
- Fallback to OpenAI/Anthropic APIs for backup
- Caching system to reduce API calls
- Direct relationship with Cerebras for priority support

Risk: Game generation speed slower than expected
Impact: Poor user experience, failed value proposition
Probability: Low (10%)
Mitigation:
- Extensive performance testing during development
- Progressive optimization of agent coordination
- Fallback to simpler games if complex generation fails
```

#### **Medium Priority Risks:**
```
Risk: Mobile performance issues with ASCII rendering
Impact: Limited audience reach
Probability: Medium (25%)
Mitigation:
- Mobile-first development approach
- Progressive enhancement for desktop features
- Lightweight rendering optimizations

Risk: Agent coordination producing inconsistent results
Impact: Poor quality games, user frustration
Probability: Medium (30%)
Mitigation:
- Extensive prompt engineering and testing
- Quality validation systems
- Human review and improvement feedback loops
```

### **Business Risks:**

#### **High Priority Risks:**
```
Risk: Competitor with similar offering launches first
Impact: Lost first-mover advantage
Probability: Low (15%)
Mitigation:
- Speed to market through hackathon launch
- Patent filing for core technical innovations
- Focus on execution excellence over feature complexity

Risk: User adoption slower than projected
Impact: Revenue shortfall, extended runway needed
Probability: Medium (35%)
Mitigation:
