## üöÄ CONTINGENCY PLANNING

### **Technical Backup Plans:**
```
Primary Demo: Live generation with judge requests
Backup 1: Pre-recorded generation with live gameplay
Backup 2: Static demo with detailed explanation
Backup 3: Presentation slides with video demos

Network Issues:
- Mobile hotspot as internet backup
- Local development server for offline demo
- Pre-loaded games that work without connection
- Video recordings of key demonstration moments
```

### **Presentation Backup Plans:**
```
Equipment Failures:
- Backup laptop with identical setup
- USB drives with demo materials
- Printed handouts with key points
- Mobile phone as last-resort demo device

Time Management:
- 3-minute version if time is short
- 6-minute version if we get extra time
- Modular sections that can be skipped or expanded
- Key points prioritized for maximum impact
```

## üéÆ LIVE INTERACTION PREPARATION

### **Judge Challenge Scenarios:**
```
"Make me a game about quantum physics"
- Game Generator: Physics puzzle with particle behavior
- Expected generation: 12-15 seconds
- Playable result: Quantum mechanics learning game

"I want something completely weird"
- Game Generator: Surreal adventure with unusual mechanics
- Expected generation: 15-18 seconds
- Playable result: Bizarre but entertaining experience

"Create a game for my grandmother"
- Game Generator: Simple, accessible, gentle gameplay

- Playable result: Rich, complex but playable game
```

### **Real-Time Adaptation:**
```
If generation takes longer than expected:
- Narrate what's happening: "Agents are discussing complexity..."
- Show technical process: "Building advanced mechanics..."
- Engage judges: "What kind of games do you usually play?"
- Maintain confidence: "Quality takes a moment, but watch this..."

If something goes wrong:
- Acknowledge briefly: "Let me try a different approach..."
- Switch to backup demo immediately
- Keep energy positive and forward-moving
